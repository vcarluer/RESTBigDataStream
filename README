= C# HTTP REST Client large data test =
Test with C# from nodejs HTTP REST:
large JSON data GET + dynamic object deserialization
large JSON data POST + object serialization

Use a nodejs server for service with JSONStream
use of HttpClient, JSON.NET and streams

Usage:
Object structure:
{
	data: []
}


* GET SERVER/SIZE 
example: http://localhost:8072/10
Get SIZE millions objects in

* GET SERVER/data/FILE
Get the file

* POST SERVER
Send an object (size hardcoded in C#)

Keys for this to work are:
- Send data in HTTP stream in chunks (not buffered)
- Serialize/Deserialize on the fly
